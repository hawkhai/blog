# Groom your appâ€™s Ruby environment with rbenv.

Use rbenv to pick a Ruby version for your application and guarantee that your
development environment matches production. Put rbenv to work with
[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) for painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof
deployments.

**Powerful in development.** Specify your app's Ruby version once, in a single
file. Keep all your teammates on the same page. No headaches running apps on
different versions of Ruby. Just Worksâ„¢ from the command line and with app
servers like [Pow](http://pow.cx). Override the Ruby version anytime: just set
an environment variable.

**Rock-solid in production.** Your application's executables are its interface
with ops. With rbenv and [Bundler
binstubs](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs) you'll
never again need to `cd` in a cron job or Chef recipe to ensure you've
selected the right runtime. The Ruby version dependency lives in one
placeâ€”your appâ€”so upgrades and rollbacks are atomic, even when you switch
versions.

**One thing well.** rbenv is concerned solely with switching Ruby versions.
It's simple and predictable. A rich plugin ecosystem lets you tailor it to
suit your needs. Compile your own Ruby versions, or use the [ruby-
build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme) plugin to automate the
process. Specify per-application environment variables with [rbenv-
vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars). See more [plugins on the
wiki](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Plugins).

rbenv%3F)

## How It Works

At a high level, rbenv intercepts Ruby commands using shim executables
injected into your `PATH`, determines which Ruby version has been specified by
your application, and passes your commands along to the correct Ruby
installation.

### Understanding PATH

When you run a command like `ruby` or `rake`, your operating system searches
through a list of directories to find an executable file with that name. This
list of directories lives in an environment variable called `PATH`, with each
directory in the list separated by a colon:

    
    
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    

Directories in `PATH` are searched from left to right, so a matching
executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes precedence over
another one at the end. In this example, the `/usr/local/bin` directory will
be searched first, then `/usr/bin`, then `/bin`.

### Understanding Shims

rbenv works by inserting a directory of _shims_ at the front of your `PATH`:

    
    
    ~/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    

Through a process called _rehashing_ , rbenv maintains shims in that directory
to match every Ruby command across every installed version of Rubyâ€”`irb`,
`gem`, `rake`, `rails`, `ruby`, and so on.

Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along to
rbenv. So with rbenv installed, when you run, say, `rake`, your operating
system will do the following:

  * Search your `PATH` for an executable file named `rake`
  * Find the rbenv shim named `rake` at the beginning of your `PATH`
  * Run the shim named `rake`, which in turn passes the command along to rbenv

### Choosing the Ruby Version

When you execute a shim, rbenv determines which Ruby version to use by reading
it from the following sources, in this order:

  1. The `RBENV_VERSION` environment variable, if specified. You can use the `rbenv shell` command to set this environment variable in your current shell session.

  2. The first `.ruby-version` file found by searching the directory of the script you are executing and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem.

  3. The first `.ruby-version` file found by searching the current working directory and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem. You can modify the `.ruby-version` file in the current working directory with the `rbenv local` command.

  4. The global `~/.rbenv/version` file. You can modify this file using the `rbenv global` command. If the global version file is not present, rbenv assumes you want to use the "system" Rubyâ€”i.e. whatever version would be run if rbenv weren't in your path.

### Locating the Ruby Installation

Once rbenv has determined which version of Ruby your application has
specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Ruby installation.

Each Ruby version is installed into its own directory under
`~/.rbenv/versions`. For example, you might have these versions installed:

  * `~/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p371/`
  * `~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p327/`
  * `~/.rbenv/versions/jruby-1.7.1/`

Version names to rbenv are simply the names of the directories in
`~/.rbenv/versions`.

## Installation

**Compatibility note** : rbenv is _incompatible_ with RVM. Please make sure to
fully uninstall RVM and remove any references to it from your shell
initialization files before installing rbenv.

### Homebrew on macOS

If you're on macOS, we recommend installing rbenv with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

  1. Install rbenv.
    
        $ brew install rbenv

Note that this also installs `ruby-build`, so you'll be ready to install other
Ruby versions out of the box.

  2. Set up rbenv in your shell.
    
        $ rbenv init

Follow the printed instructions to set up rbenv shell integration.

  3. Close your Terminal window and open a new one so your changes take effect.

  4. Verify that rbenv is properly set up using this [rbenv-doctor](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/blob/master/bin/rbenv-doctor) script:
    
        $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
    Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
    Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
    Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20170523)
    Counting installed Ruby versions: none
      There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `~/.rbenv/versions'.
      You can install Ruby versions like so: rbenv install 2.2.4
    Checking RubyGems settings: OK
    Auditing installed plugins: OK

  5. That's it! Installing rbenv includes ruby-build, so now you're ready to install some other Ruby versions using `rbenv install`.

#### Upgrading with Homebrew

To upgrade to the latest rbenv and update ruby-build with newly released Ruby
versions, upgrade the Homebrew packages:

    
    
    $ brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build

### Basic GitHub Checkout

For a more automated install, you can use [rbenv-
installer](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#rbenv-installer). If you
prefer a manual approach, follow the steps below.

This will get you going with the latest version of rbenv without needing a
systemwide install.

  1. Clone rbenv into `~/.rbenv`.
    
        $ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv

Optionally, try to compile dynamic bash extension to speed up rbenv. Don't
worry if it fails; rbenv will still work normally:

    
        $ cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
    

  2. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `rbenv` command-line utility.

    * For **bash** :
        
                $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    * For **Ubuntu Desktop** :
        
                $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

    * For **Zsh** :
        
                $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

    * For **Fish shell** :
        
                $ set -Ux fish_user_paths $HOME/.rbenv/bin $fish_user_paths

  3. Set up rbenv in your shell.
    
        $ ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init

Follow the printed instructions to set up rbenv shell integration.

  4. Restart your shell so that PATH changes take effect. (Opening a new terminal tab will usually do it.)

  5. Verify that rbenv is properly set up using this [rbenv-doctor](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/blob/master/bin/rbenv-doctor) script:
    
        $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
    Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
    Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
    Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20170523)
    Counting installed Ruby versions: none
      There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `~/.rbenv/versions'.
      You can install Ruby versions like so: rbenv install 2.2.4
    Checking RubyGems settings: OK
    Auditing installed plugins: OK

  6. _(Optional)_ Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme), which provides the `rbenv install` command that simplifies the process of installing new Ruby versions.

#### Upgrading with Git

If you've installed rbenv manually using Git, you can upgrade to the latest
version by pulling from GitHub:

    
    
    $ cd ~/.rbenv
    $ git pull

#### Updating the list of available Ruby versions

If you're using the `rbenv install` command, then the list of available Ruby
versions is not automatically updated when pulling from the rbenv repo. To do
this manually:

    
    
    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    $ git pull

### How rbenv hooks into your shell

Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell profile
is doing.

`rbenv init` is the only command that crosses the line of loading extra
commands into your shell. Coming from RVM, some of you might be opposed to
this idea. Here's what `rbenv init` actually does:

  1. Sets up your shims path. This is the only requirement for rbenv to function properly. You can do this by hand by prepending `~/.rbenv/shims` to your `$PATH`.

  2. Installs autocompletion. This is entirely optional but pretty useful. Sourcing `~/.rbenv/completions/rbenv.bash` will set that up. There is also a `~/.rbenv/completions/rbenv.zsh` for Zsh users.

  3. Rehashes shims. From time to time you'll need to rebuild your shim files. Doing this automatically makes sure everything is up to date. You can always run `rbenv rehash` manually.

  4. Installs the sh dispatcher. This bit is also optional, but allows rbenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell, making commands like `rbenv shell` possible. The sh dispatcher doesn't do anything invasive like override `cd` or hack your shell prompt, but if for some reason you need `rbenv` to be a real script rather than a shell function, you can safely skip it.

Run `rbenv init -` for yourself to see exactly what happens under the hood.

### Installing Ruby versions

The `rbenv install` command doesn't ship with rbenv out of the box, but is
provided by the [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme)
project. If you installed it either as part of GitHub checkout process
outlined above or via Homebrew, you should be able to:

    
    
    # list latest stable versions:
    $ rbenv install -l
    
    # list all local versions:
    $ rbenv install -L
    
    # install a Ruby version:
    $ rbenv install 2.0.0-p247

Set a Ruby version to finish installation and start using commands `rbenv
global 2.0.0-p247` or `rbenv local 2.0.0-p247`

Alternatively to the `install` command, you can download and compile Ruby
manually as a subdirectory of `~/.rbenv/versions/`. An entry in that directory
can also be a symlink to a Ruby version installed elsewhere on the filesystem.
rbenv doesn't care; it will simply treat any entry in the `versions/`
directory as a separate Ruby version.

#### Installing Ruby gems

Once you've installed some Ruby versions, you'll want to install gems. First,
ensure that the target version for your project is the one you want by
checking `rbenv version` (see Command Reference). Select another version using
`rbenv local 2.0.0-p247`, for example. Then, proceed to install gems as you
normally would:

    
    
    $ gem install bundler

**You don't need sudo** to install gems. Typically, the Ruby versions will be
installed and writeable by your user. No extra privileges are required to
install gems.

Check the location where gems are being installed with `gem env`:

    
    
    $ gem env home
    # => ~/.rbenv/versions/<ruby-version>/lib/ruby/gems/...

### Uninstalling Ruby versions

As time goes on, Ruby versions you install will accumulate in your
`~/.rbenv/versions` directory.

To remove old Ruby versions, simply `rm -rf` the directory of the version you
want to remove. You can find the directory of a particular Ruby version with
the `rbenv prefix` command, e.g. `rbenv prefix 1.8.7-p357`.

The [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme) plugin provides
an `rbenv uninstall` command to automate the removal process.

### Uninstalling rbenv

The simplicity of rbenv makes it easy to temporarily disable it, or uninstall
from the system.

  1. To **disable** rbenv managing your Ruby versions, simply remove the `rbenv init` line from your shell startup configuration. This will remove rbenv shims directory from PATH, and future invocations like `ruby` will execute the system Ruby version, as before rbenv.

`rbenv` will still be accessible on the command line, but your Ruby apps won't
be affected by version switching.

  2. To completely **uninstall** rbenv, perform step (1) and then remove its root directory. This will **delete all Ruby versions** that were installed under ``rbenv root`/versions/` directory:
    
         rm -rf `rbenv root`
    

If you've installed rbenv using a package manager, as a final step perform the
rbenv package removal. For instance, for Homebrew:

    
         brew uninstall rbenv
    

## Command Reference

Like `git`, the `rbenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its first
argument. The most common subcommands are:

### rbenv local

Sets a local application-specific Ruby version by writing the version name to
a `.ruby-version` file in the current directory. This version overrides the
global version, and can be overridden itself by setting the `RBENV_VERSION`
environment variable or with the `rbenv shell` command.

    
    
    $ rbenv local 1.9.3-p327
    

When run without a version number, `rbenv local` reports the currently
configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

    
    
    $ rbenv local --unset
    

### rbenv global

Sets the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells by writing the
version name to the `~/.rbenv/version` file. This version can be overridden by
an application-specific `.ruby-version` file, or by setting the
`RBENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    
    
    $ rbenv global 1.8.7-p352
    

The special version name `system` tells rbenv to use the system Ruby (detected
by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `rbenv global` reports the currently
configured global version.

### rbenv shell

Sets a shell-specific Ruby version by setting the `RBENV_VERSION` environment
variable in your shell. This version overrides application-specific versions
and the global version.

    
    
    $ rbenv shell jruby-1.7.1
    

When run without a version number, `rbenv shell` reports the current value of
`RBENV_VERSION`. You can also unset the shell version:

    
    
    $ rbenv shell --unset
    

Note that you'll need rbenv's shell integration enabled (step 3 of the
installation instructions) in order to use this command. If you prefer not to
use shell integration, you may simply set the `RBENV_VERSION` variable
yourself:

    
    
    $ export RBENV_VERSION=jruby-1.7.1
    

### rbenv versions

Lists all Ruby versions known to rbenv, and shows an asterisk next to the
currently active version.

    
    
    $ rbenv versions
      1.8.7-p352
      1.9.2-p290
    * 1.9.3-p327 (set by /Users/sam/.rbenv/version)
      jruby-1.7.1
      rbx-1.2.4
      ree-1.8.7-2011.03
    

### rbenv version

Displays the currently active Ruby version, along with information on how it
was set.

    
    
    $ rbenv version
    1.9.3-p327 (set by /Users/sam/.rbenv/version)
    

### rbenv rehash

Installs shims for all Ruby executables known to rbenv (i.e.,
`~/.rbenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new version
of Ruby, or install a gem that provides commands.

    
    
    $ rbenv rehash
    

### rbenv which

Displays the full path to the executable that rbenv will invoke when you run
the given command.

    
    
    $ rbenv which irb
    /Users/sam/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p327/bin/irb
    

### rbenv whence

Lists all Ruby versions with the given command installed.

    
    
    $ rbenv whence rackup
    1.9.3-p327
    jruby-1.7.1
    ree-1.8.7-2011.03
    

## Environment variables

You can affect how rbenv operates with the following settings:

name | default | description  
---|---|---  
`RBENV_VERSION` |  | Specifies the Ruby version to be used.  
Also see `rbenv shell`  
`RBENV_ROOT` | `~/.rbenv` | Defines the directory under which Ruby versions
and shims reside.  
Also see `rbenv root`  
`RBENV_DEBUG` |  | Outputs debug information.  
Also as: `rbenv --debug <subcommand>`  
`RBENV_HOOK_PATH` | [_see
wiki_](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins#rbenv-hooks) |
Colon-separated list of paths searched for rbenv hooks.  
`RBENV_DIR` | `$PWD` | Directory to start searching for `.ruby-version` files.  
  
## Development

The rbenv source code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).
It's clean, modular, and easy to understand, even if you're not a shell
hacker.

Tests are executed using [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats):

    
    
    $ bats test
    $ bats test/<file>.bats
