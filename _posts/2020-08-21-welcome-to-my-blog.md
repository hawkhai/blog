Hey, there! Welcome to my blog. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff in here. Nothing fancy, really. Just bits and bobs about tech and random topics.<br/><br/>
Enjoy!

## Test MathJax

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$
for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$
divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$.
The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
