# Getting colored output working on Windows

Jump to bottom

On Windows, sometimes the RSpec output shows [ANSI escape
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) instead of correctly
colored output. You might see something that looks like this:

    
    
    [32m.[0m[32m.[0m[32m.[0m[32m.[0m[32m.[0m[32m.[0m
    

Some versions of Windows aren't able to correctly interpret those ANSI escape
codes and turn them into the nicely colored text that you should see.

You also might see a warning message that starts with:

    
    
    You must use ANSICON...
    

There are a few different ways you can get your Windows system to correctly
interpret the ANSI codes. They all involve installing tools, but it's usually
very straightforward.

You need to (1) install ANSICON and/or (2) install and use a different
console/console emulator or shell that handles colors (ANSI escape codes).

  1. **[ANSICON](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon)** is a program for Windows that interprets ANSI escape codes so that color is displayed. It kind of runs 'on top of' cmd or powershell. You can set it up so that it's always used whenever you use cmd or powershell, or use it only at specific times. Most people install this and are really happy with it. Jason Karns wrote [a blog post about installing and using ANSICON](http://jasonkarns.com/blog/ansi-color-in-windows-shells/) (including using it for git bash on Windows) that folks have found helpful.

  2. Here are the popular options for alternatives to cmd/powershell. These are console emulators, tools, and shell alternatives:

  * **[ConEmu](http://conemu.github.io/)** \- ("ConEmu-Maximus5") This is a console emulator, not a shell. You can use it with any shell (cmd, powershell, cygwin, bash, etc). But in day-to-day use, once you set it up, you use it just like you'd use cmd.exe or powershell, etc. You can set up different configurations (e.g. to run commands before it starts so that it is in a certain configuration). Supports multiple tabs and a list of windows.

  * **[Console 2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)** \- Like ConEmu, this is a console emulator that adds functionality above and beyond cmd.exe (including displaying ANSI colors). You can use it with existing shells (e.g. powershell, etc.).

  * **[Console Z](https://github.com/cbucher/console)** \- a fork of Console 2 that is current and actively maintained.

You can also (or instead of) use a Unix-like suite of tools that runs on
Windows:

  * **[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)** \- The best known suite of Unix-like commands that runs in Windows. Comes with shells (e.g. MinTTY) that can be used and will work with ANSI codes

    * **[Babun](http://babun.github.io/index.html)** \- A Windows shell that sits on top of a Cygwin install. Configurable; you can create configurations (e.g. for git bash or rvm or whatever) and share them as plug-ins. (Uses the mitty console.)
  * **[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)** \- A "Minimalist GNU for Windows" that has a [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) toolset for windows, focused on those tools needed for development. (IOW, it's a smaller and slightly different set than Cygwin provides.) [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/), used to compile ruby gems into native Windows code, uses MinGW.

    * **[MinSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS)** \- "[A] contraction of " **Min** imal **SYS** tem", is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this provides a general purpose command line environment, which is particularly suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source applications to the MS-Windows platform; a light-weight fork of Cygwin-1.3, it includes a small selection of Unix tools, chosen to facilitate that objective." ( _\- from the MinGW site_ )

If you have trouble installing any of these, do a search on
[StackOverflow](http://www.stackOverflow.com). Many folks have posted helpful
information there.

Some searching might turn up additional options. These are the options most
talked about and used.

If you have any additional methods or tools to add, please add them to this
page.
