See forum and TestIrrlichtControllers for more information on how to use.

Also:

 - some bug fixes
 - file header copyright is now properly updated for the current year \(2013 instead of 2011\).
 - Controllers extensions are not included for the moment, you will have to implement them yourself. See TestIrrlichtControllers, a sinus controller and a multiplexer are implemented.
 - Demos are updated with new lib and newer Irrlicht version.
 - Updated doxygen
 - Updated demos projects, it now includes Irrlicht demos correctly \(you will have to check a checkbox in cmake-gui for them to be included\).")

## Build guide

Note:

    
    
    ${SPARK_DIR} refers to the folder where SPARK is installed.
    

Source directories:

    
    
    - For the engine : ${SPARK_DIR}/projects/engine
    - For the demos : ${SPARK_DIR}/projects/demos
    

Recommended build directory:

    
    
    - For the engine : ${SPARK_DIR}/projects/build/engine
    - For the demos : ${SPARK_DIR}/projects/build/demos
    

To build a project (engine or demos):

    
    
    First, you have to know how CMake works. If not, there are plenty of tutorials on the net.
    When configuring projects for the first time, verify the variables which start with 'SPARK_',
    of 'DEMOS_' if you configure the demos.
    Note that SPARK release dlls are automatically copied to the 'demos/bin' folder.
    

Note:

    
    
    Libraries are put in the folder ${SPARK_DIR}/lib/<system-name>@<generator>/<build-type>
    where:
    	<system-name> is the name of your OS (ex: Windows)
    	<generator> is the name of the generator used (ex: Visual Studio 10)
    	<build-type> is 'dynamic' or 'static', depending on the project settings. (see SPARK_STATIC_BUILD variable)
    
    Demos are put in ${SPARK_DIR}/demos/bin
