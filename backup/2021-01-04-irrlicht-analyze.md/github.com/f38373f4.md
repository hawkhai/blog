    ==========================================================================
    The Irrlicht Engine SDK version 1.9
    ==========================================================================
    
      Welcome to the Irrlicht Engine SDK.
    
      Content of this file:
    
      1. Directory Structure Overview
      2. How To Start
      3. Requirements
      4. Release Notes
      5. License
      6. Contact
    
    
    ==========================================================================
    1. Directory Structure Overview
    ==========================================================================
    
      You will find some directories after uncompressing the archive of the
      SDK. These are:
    
      \bin         The compiled library Irrlicht.DLL and some compiled demo
                   and example applications, just start them to see the
                   Irrlicht Engine in action. Windows only.
      \doc         Documentation of the Irrlicht Engine.
      \examples    Examples and tutorials showing how to use the engine with
                   C++.
      \include     Header files to include when programming with the engine.
      \lib         Libs to link with your programs when using the engine.
      \media       Graphics and sound resources for the demo applications and
                   examples.
      \source      The source code of the Irrlicht Engine. This code is
                   not needed to develop applications with the engine,
                   but it is included to enable recompilation and
                   debugging, if necessary.
      \tools       Useful tools (with sourcecode) for the engine.
    
    
    
    ==========================================================================
    2. How to start
    ==========================================================================
    
      To see the engine in action in Windows, just go to the \bin\Win32-VisualStudio
      directory, and start some applications. There should also be an
      application named Demo.exe which should show the most
      interesting features of Irrlicht.
    
      To start developing own applications and games with the engine take
      a look at the 01.HelloWorld example in the \examples directory.
      There is also a .html file with a tutorial which should be
      easily comprehensible.
    
      The Irrlicht Engine is a static lib under linux. A precompiled version can be
      generated from the sources using the Makefile in source/Irrlicht. Run 'make' in 
      that subfolder. After this you should be able to 'make' all
      example applications in /examples by calling the buildAllExamples script. You 
      can run the examples then from the bin folder.
    
      It is also possible to use Irrlicht as shared object
      (libIrrlicht.so.versionNumber). Use the proper makefile target for this by
      running 'make sharedlib' in the source folder. See the Makefile for details.
    
      For OSX you can find an XCode project file in source/Irrlicht/MacOSX. This will
      build the libIrrlicht.a library necessary to create the apps.
    
    ==========================================================================
    3. Requirements
    ==========================================================================
    
      You can use one of the following compilers/IDEs to develop applications
      with Irrlicht or recompile the engine. However, other compilers/IDEs may
      work as well, we simply didn't test them.
    
      * gcc 4.x
      * Visual Studio 2010(10.0)-2013(12.0)
      * Code::Blocks (& gcc or visual studio toolkit)
      
      If you ever want to (re)compile the engine yourself (which means you don't
      want to use the precompiled version) you need the following:
    
      * Windows:
    	* Needed: PlatformSDK (which usually comes with all IDEs, download
    			it separately for MSVC Express 2005)
    	* Optional: DirectX SDK, for D3D9 support
    	* Optional: DirectX SDK prior to May 2006, for D3D8 support
    
      * Linux:
    	* Needed: XServer with include files
    	* Optional: OpenGL headers and libraries (libGL.so) for OpenGL support
    		GLX +
    		XF86VidMode [package x11proto-xf86vidmode-dev] or XRandr
    		(X11 support libraries, the latter two for fullscreen mode)
    
      * OSX:
    	* Needed: XCode and Cocoa framework
    	* Needed: OpenGL headers and libraries
    
    ==========================================================================
    4. Release Notes
    ==========================================================================
    
      Informations about changes in this new version of the engine can be
      found in changes.txt.
    
      Please note that the textures, 3D models and levels are copyright
      by their authors and not covered by the Irrlicht engine license.
    
    ==========================================================================
    5. License
    ==========================================================================
    
      The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license.
      Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
      using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement
      would be highly appreciated.
    
      Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of
      the Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng. This means that if you use
      the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere
      in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng. It would
      also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib.
      See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for
      further informations.
