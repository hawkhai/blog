[Change log for June 8, 2020 Vulkan 1.2.144 spec

2020 Vulkan 1.2.144 spec update:

  * Update release number to 144 for this update.

Internal Issues:

  * Require `volatile` semantics for loading <<builtin-volatile-semantics,
    certain variables used in ray pipeline stages>> in the
    <<spirvenv-module-validation, Validation Rules within a Module>> and
    also the <<ray-tracing-shader-call, Shader Call Instructions>> section
    \(internal issue 1924\).
  * Created new <<potential-format-features, Potential Format Features>>
    section and corresponding glossary term, use the new term where
    appropriate, and add some related valid usage statements to
    flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass, flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass2,
    slink:VkSubpassDescription, and slink:VkSubpassDescription2 \(internal
    issue 2031\).
  * Add interaction with `<<VK_KHR_ray_tracing>>` and corresponding `NV`
    extension to flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate \(internal issue
    2193\).
  * Resolve collisions in common VUID names using `{stageMaskName}`
    qualifiers as part of the name and make fixes to
    `config/vu-to-json/extension.rb` to match \(internal issue 2215\).
  * Replace `shutil.move` operations with `copy` / `remove` in the base
    `generator.py` code, working around a problem with bind mounts while
    using the Khronos docker build image with `podman` instead of `docker`
    \(internal merge request 3872\).
  * Add a new <<spirvenv-extensions, SPIR-V Extensions>> subsection
    containing a table showing the corresponding Vulkan extension or core
    API required to support each of the SPIR-V extensions, replacing a
    harder-to-read list of extensions \(internal merge request 3876\).
  * Remove two redundant valid usage statements from flik:vkCmdResolveImage
    \(internal merge request 3878\).
  * Make repository REUSE-compliant, and run the `reuse` license checker as
    part of internal CI. While most files now have SPDX license identifier
    tags, some licenses are recorded in `.reuse/dep5` instead. Note that
    this does not change licenses in the repository \(aside from adding some
    to files missing them\), just insures that every file *has* an explicit
    license \(internal merge request 3904\).
  * Clarify that code:ImageMSArray is supported as part of the
    <<features-shaderStorageImageMultisample>> feature \(internal merge
    request 3905\).
  * Reorganize some valid usage statements for flink:vkCmdBlitImage,
    flink:vkCmdCopyBuffer, flink:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage,
    flink:vkCmdCopyImage, flink:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer, and
    flink:vkCmdResolveImage as common valid usage statements, for
    future-proofing \(internal merge requests 3906, 3907, 3908, 3909, 3910\).
  * Add two valid usage statements to flink:vkAllocateMemory and
    flink:vkCreateSampler for allocation limits of slink:VkDeviceMemory and
    elink:VkSamplers, respectively \(internal merge request 3923\).")

14, 2020 Vulkan 1.2.165 spec update:

  * Update release number to 165 for this update.

Github Issues:

  * Fix interaction between imageless framebuffers and
    slink:VkImageViewUsageCreateInfo for slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo,
    elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits, and in the
    <<resources-image-inherited-usage>> section \(public issue 1391\).
  * Fix `vk.xml` `optional` / `noautovalidity` attributes and corresponding
    explicit valid usage statements for
    slink:VkBuildAccelerationStructureModeKHR \(public issue 1405\).
  * Remove redundant / incomplete handle comments from `vk.xml` for
    elink:VkObjectType enumerants \(public merge request 1412\).

Internal Issues:

  * Create valid usage statements from constraints in the
    <<spirvenv-module-validation-standalone, Standalone SPIR-V Validation>>
    section \(internal issue 2394\).
  * Fix valid usage staement 01256 for slink:VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR
    \(internal issue 2404\).
  * Expand and clarify the event race condition warning for
    flink:vkCmdWaitEvents to include two additional scenarios in which the
    effect and/or state of an event becomes undefined without additional
    synchronization operations \(internal issue 2411\).
  * Update valid usage statement for flink:vkSetLocalDimmingAMD \(internal
    issue 2446\).
  * Recast slink:VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR valid usage statements in
    terms of size being non-zero, instead of pname:deviceAddress \(internal
    issue 2450\).
  * Add missing ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT valid usage statement for
    flink:vkQueueSubmit \(internal merge request 4244\).
  * Add limits related to local size to the
    <<spirvenv-module-validation-runtime, Runtime SPIR-V Validation>>
    section \(internal merge request 4255\).
  * Fix typo in description of
    slink:VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntry::pname:dstArrayElement \(internal
    merge request 4260\).
  * Remove repeated "`all`" from slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo valid
    usage statements \(internal merge request 4266\).
  * Fix internal xrefs to the SPIR-V capabilities tables, which broke as a
    side effect of generating the table instead of handcoding it \(internal
    merge request 4270\).
  * Fix normative language for code:WorkgroupSize \(internal merge request
    4272\).
  * Restore `len` attribute to `vk.xml` after its recent accidental removal
    from slink:VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo::pname:pSetLayouts \(internal
    merge request 4275\).
  * Remove trailing periods from SPIR-V valid usage statements \(internal
    merge request 4284\).
  * Base PDF theme on builtin fallback theme, simplifying it and adding
    support for some math characters not found in the default theme
    \(internal merge request 4287\).")

  * Clarify in the <<extendingvulkan-extensions-extensiondependencies,

2020 Vulkan 1.2.137 spec update:

  * Update release number to 137 for this update.

Github Issues:

  * Incorporate several changes to the specification build process and HTML
    load-time scripts which pre-render KaTeX math, pre-fetch fonts, and
    perform several other optimizations which can significantly improve load
    time for the single-page HTML specification. In our internal evaluation
    these changes appear to primarily help when using Chrome or Chromium,
    with smaller improvements for Firefox and Safari. Speedups seem more
    significant on Linux, Windows, and Android platforms, while MacOS
    browsers may benefit less \(public pull requests 702, 704, and 708\).
  * Clarify that code:OpVariable is decorated with code:Location, not
    code:OpTypeStruct in the <<interfaces-iointerfaces-locations, Location
    Assignment>> section \(public issue 1203\).
  * Add a NOTE about the WSI origin location in the description of
    flink:vkQueuePresentKHR \(public pull request 1208\).
  * Add the `null-terminated` attribute to
    slink:VkPerformanceValueDataINTEL::pname:valueString in `vk.xml` \(public
    pull request 1209\).
  * Mark slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Properties and
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Properties structures as `returnedonly` in
    `vk.xml` \(public pull request 1210\).
  * Create explicit valid usage statements from text in the description of
    slink:VkValidationFeaturesEXT \(public pull request 1212\).
  * Update style guide to add "`user`" to the list of words *not* to use,
    instead recommending "`application`" \(public pull request 1213\).
  * Fix typos where `ext` was used in the style guide instead of the new
    `apiext` asciidoctor macro \(public pull request 1214\).
  * Miscellaneous minor markup and editing fixes \(public pull request 1215\).
  * Remove etext:KHR from promoted ename:VK_MAX_DRIVER_NAME_SIZE in the
    description of slink:VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties \(public pull
    request 1218\).
  * Correct use of `NULL` to dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE in the
    <<acceleration-structure-inactive-prims, Inactive Primitives and
    Instances>> section \(public pull request 1219\).
  * Remove trailing periods on valid usage statement text, as required by
    the style guide, and add `scripts/deperiodize_vuids.py` to do this in
    the future if needed \(public pull request 1220\).

Internal Issues:

  * Provide a warning in the repository `README.adoc` of pending header
    changes to remove etext:VK_*_BEGIN_RANGE, etext:VK_*_END_RANGE, and
    etext:VK_*_RANGE_SIZE tokens \(internal issue 872\).
  * Describe the meaning of code:Device for the `<<VK_KHR_shader_clock>>`
    extension in the <<shaders-scope-device, Device>>,
    <<shaders-scope-queue-family, Queue Family>>, and
    <<shaders-scope-command, Command>> sections of the shader
    <<shaders-scope, Scope>> section \(internal issue 1955\).
  * Allow slink:VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT::pname:pObjectName to be
    either NULL or an empty string to remove a previously set name \(internal
    issue #2019\).
  * Add missing VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY error code in `vk.xml` for
    flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion \(internal issue 2029\).
  * Require code:R32i or code:R32ui image format for
    code:OpImageTexelPointer atomic operations in the
    <<spirvenv-module-validation, Validation Rules within a Module>> section
    \(internal issue 2049\).
  * Remove the `<pattern>` element from images used in the specification, to
    avoid complaints from prawn-svg during PDF spec builds \(internal issue
    2053\).
  * Clarify usable sample counts for empty subpasses in the
    <<features-variableMultisampleRate>> section and the related
    flink:vkCmdBindPipeline valid usage statement, as well as in the
    <<limits-framebufferNoAttachmentsSampleCounts>>
    <<renderpass-noattachments>> sections \(internal issue 2066\).
  * Clarify pname:aspectMask usage in render passes in
    slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo valid usage statement 01565 and in
    slink:VkAttachmentReference2 \(internal merge request 3664\).
  * Remove unused etext:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_INFO_KHR
    token from `vk.xml` and the `<<VK_KHR_ray_tracing>>` appendix
    \(internal merge request 3680\).
  * Require <<features-subgroup-extended-types,
    pname:shaderSubgroupExtendedTypes>> for Vulkan 1.2 \(internal merge
    request 3680\).
  * Generate symlinks from refpage aliases to the API they're aliasing
    \(internal merge request 3694\).
  * Add an alias from the old ename:VK_ANDROID_NATIVE_BUFFER_EXTENSION_NAME
    token \(internal merge request 3697\).
  * Add `scripts/compImages.sh` to compare all images in two git branches of
    the specification \(internal merge request 3699\).
  * Improve valid usage statements for `<<VK_NV_device_generated_commands>>`
    in flink:vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsNV,
    slink:VkGeneratedCommandsInfoNV,
    flink:vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsNV,
    slink:VkIndirectCommandsStreamNV, slink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenNV
    and slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo \(internal merge request 3702\).
  * Clarify differences between `<<VK_NV_ray_tracing>>` and
    `<<VK_KHR_ray_tracing>>` for
    slink:VkPipelineCreationFeedbackCreateInfoEXT pipeline creation,
    pname:shaderGroupHandleSize and pname:maxRecursionDepth limit
    requirement differences, and detangle `SPV_KHR/NV_ray_tracing` in the
    <<spirvenv-capabilities-table, List of SPIR-V Capabilities and enabling
    features or extensions>> \(internal merge request 3710\).
  * Add flink:vkGetImageViewAddressNVX and
    slink:VkImageViewAddressPropertiesNVX to `<<VK_NVX_image_view_handle>>`
    \(internal merge request 3710\).
  * Shorten 'make' output by reducing redundant logging output from refpage
    build targets \(internal merge request 3729\).
  * Replace sname: macro with slink: everywhere except language actually
    describing the structure in the macro argument \(internal merge request
    3728\).
  * Add flink:vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2 and
    flink:vkGetImageMemoryRequirements2 to the commands for which the
    implementation makes guarantees about certain properties of the memory
    requirements in the <<resources-association, Resource Memory
    Association>> section, following the description of
    slink:VkMemoryRequirements \(internal merge request 3730\).
  * Add valid usage statements for
    `<<VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer>>` \(internal merge
    request 3731\).
  * Add requirements on the
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureMemoryRequirementsInfoKHR acceleration
    structure for which memory type bits must be exposed \(internal
    advisorypanel issue 28\).

  * Update release number to 164 for this update.

Github Issues:

  * Reserve vendor ID for PoCL \(public pull request 1411\).

Internal Issues:

  * Add valid usage statements to ray tracing commands requiring they be
    given a ray tracing pipeline, and removing support for
    ename:ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_GENERIC in
    flink:vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructureNV \(internal issue 2271\).
  * Add valid usage statements disallowing the use of protected command
    buffers with Ray Tracing Pipelines and Ray Query instructions \(internal
    issue 2409\).
  * Move the un-numbered glossary / abbreviations / prefixes pseudo-chapters
    into a single appendix, so the table of contents looks cleaner \(internal
    issue 2437\).
  * Remove redundant valid usage statement from
    slink:VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo \(internal merge request 4229\).
  * Add missing <<features-inlineUniformBlock>> valid usage statement to
    slink:VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding \(internal merge request 4246\).
  * Tweak example of Docker image invocation in `BUILD.adoc` \(internal merge
    request 4249\).
  * Capitalize code:LaunchIdKHR the same as in SPIR-V. code:LaunchSizeKHR
    and code:LaunchIdKHR are accessible in the code:CallableKHR shader stage
    \(internal merge request 4252\).
  * Remove unreachable \(redundant\) valid usage statements from
    flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass and flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass2 \(internal
    merge request 4254\).
  * Add missing `objtypeenum` attribute to `vk.xml` for slink:VkInstance
    \(internal merge request 4263\).
  * Change the chunked HTML target to use a more robust method of inserting
    additional Javascript and HTML to support the searchbox.

New Extensions:

  * `<<VK_NV_acquire_winrt_display>>`
  * `<<VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type>>`")

Github Issues:

  * Move `translate_math.js` to the `scripts/` directory \(public pull

  * Minor cleanup of math markup \(public pull request 1287\).

Internal Issues:

  * Misc. licensing updates \(internal issue 1017\):
  ** Replace the "`Exceptions`" clause on `vk.xml` with a dual Apache-2.0 OR
     MIT license, with agreement of downstream developers known to be
     affected by it. This enables use of `vk.xml` in GPLed projects under a
     more widely used licensing scheme.
  ** Use `SPDX-License-Identifier` tags in place of longer license text.
     This does not change the license terms on files other than `vk.xml`,
     but makes license statements in most files more compact.
  ** Reorganize repository documentation \(README.adoc, COPYING.adoc,
     LICENSE.adoc, CONTRIBUTING.adoc, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc, and BUILD.adoc\)
     with a more widely used split of information; make all of these files
     Asciidoctor instead of Markdown format for consistency with the rest of
     the repository; describe use of SPDX identifiers; and point to full
     license text of the various OSS licenses used in the repository.
  * Add new <<resources-image-views-identity-mappings, text describing the
    identity swizzle>> incorporating the existing "`Component Mappings
    Equivalent To ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_IDENTITY`" table, and refer to
    this text in place of explicit references to
    ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_IDENTITY in many places \(internal merge
    request 3399\).
  * Require code:storageBuffer16BitAccess capability if
    `<<VK_KHR_16bit_storage>>` is enabled \(internal merge request 3709\).
  * Added XML schema and generator script extensions to support 64-bit flags
    and corresponding bitmasks \(internal merge request 3718\).
  * Correct <<interfaces-resources-standard-layout, Standard Buffer Layout>>
    alignment rules \(internal merge request 3750\).
  * Relax non-strict line constraints in the <<primsrast-lines-basic>> and
    <<primsrast-lines-bresenham>> sections \(internal merge request 3792\).
  * Add missing `structextends` attribute to the
    slink:VkPhysicalDevicePrivateDataFeaturesEXT definition in `vk.xml`
    \(internal merge request 3873\).
  * Move slink:VkImageFormatListCreateInfo valid usage statements to
    flink:vkCreateImageView \(internal merge request 3879\).
  * Update valid usage statements for slink:VkImageViewASTCDecodeModeEXT to
    allow ASTC HDR formats \(internal merge request 3881\).
  * Add missing extension dependency to
    `<<VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties>>` definition in `vk.xml`

  * Change the etext:VK_QUERY_SCOPE_* tokens in the
    slink:VkPerformanceCounterScopeKHR to aliases of new
    etext:VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_* tokens, following the naming
    conventions for enumerants \(public issue 1130\).
  * Move `NV` extension pipe stages in elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits so they
    are not included in enmae:VK_SHADER_STAGE_ALL_GRAPHICS \(public pull

    `config/vu-to-json/extension.rb` to match \(internal issue 2215\).
  * Replace `shutil.move` operations with `copy` / `remove` in the base
    `generator.py` code, working around a problem with bind mounts while
    using the Khronos docker build image with `podman` instead of `docker`
    \(internal merge request 3872\).
  * Add a new <<spirvenv-extensions, SPIR-V Extensions>> subsection
    containing a table showing the corresponding Vulkan extension or core
    API required to support each of the SPIR-V extensions, replacing a
    harder-to-read list of extensions \(internal merge request 3876\).
  * Remove two redundant valid usage statements from flik:vkCmdResolveImage
    \(internal merge request 3878\).
  * Make repository REUSE-compliant, and run the `reuse` license checker as
    part of internal CI. While most files now have SPDX license identifier
    tags, some licenses are recorded in `.reuse/dep5` instead. Note that
    this does not change licenses in the repository \(aside from adding some
    to files missing them\), just insures that every file *has* an explicit
    license \(internal merge request 3904\).
  * Clarify that code:ImageMSArray is supported as part of the
    <<features-shaderStorageImageMultisample>> feature \(internal merge
    request 3905\).
  * Reorganize some valid usage statements for flink:vkCmdBlitImage,
    flink:vkCmdCopyBuffer, flink:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage,
    flink:vkCmdCopyImage, flink:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer, and
    flink:vkCmdResolveImage as common valid usage statements, for
    future-proofing \(internal merge requests 3906, 3907, 3908, 3909, 3910\).
  * Add two valid usage statements to flink:vkAllocateMemory and
    flink:vkCreateSampler for allocation limits of slink:VkDeviceMemory and
    elink:VkSamplers, respectively \(internal merge request 3923\).")

# Vulkan® API Documentation Project

This repository contains sources for the formal documentation of the Vulkan
API. This includes:

  * The Vulkan API Specification

  * Specification of Vulkan extensions

  * API reference (“man”) pages

  * The XML API Registry (also mirrored at [Vulkan-Headers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers))

  * Vulkan header files (also mirrored at [Vulkan-Headers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers))

  * Related tools and scripts.

The authoritative public repository is located at [Vulkan-
Docs](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/). It hosts a public Issue
tracker, and outside developers can file proposed changes (Pull Requests)
against the Specification, subject to approval by Khronos.

If in doubt where to submit your Issue, consult the [Vulkan-
Ecosystem](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Ecosystem) repository.

## External Contributions

Khronos welcomes feedback in Github Issues, and proposed changes in Github
Pull Requests (PRs), but will not necessarily accept all such changes.

Please keep your issues and pull requests focused on solving a single problem.
Broader feedback that tries to solve multiple problems, or touches many parts
of the Specification at once, is difficult for the Vulkan Working Group to
review in a timely fashion.

## Branch Structure

The current Specification is maintained in the default branch (currently
`main`) of the repository. From this branch it is possible to generate
Specifications for any published version of Vulkan (1.2, 1.1, and 1.0), and
incorporating any desired set of extensions. Each published update is tagged
in the form `1.2. **release**` where **release** is a constantly incrementing
release number and `1.2` is the latest published version of the API. The last
public spec update prior to Vulkan 1.2 is tagged `v1.1.130`.

The last state of the default branch in Khronos' internal gitlab server,
before 1.2 content was merged into it, is tagged `1.1-archive` (this tag is
not in github).

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

    xml/                  XML API Registry (vk.xml)
    registry.txt          Sources for documentation of the vk.xml format

## Building the Specification and Reference Pages

The document sources are marked up in Asciidoctor format, and we use
`asciidoctor` and related toolchain components to generate output documents.
See [BUILD.adoc](/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/main/BUILD.adoc) for more
information on installing the toolchain and building the Specification.

## Generating Headers and Related Files

See [xml/README.adoc](/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/main/xml/README.adoc).

The header files (`include/vulkan/vulkan*.h`) and many parts of the
specification and reference page documents are generated from descriptions in
the XML API Registry ([`xml/vk.xml`](/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-
Docs/blob/main/xml/vk.xml)). The generated files are not checked into the
repository. If you change `vk.xml`, you can regenerate the headers by going
into `xml/` and running:

    
    
    $ make clean install

The other generated files are built as required via dependencies in the top-
level `Makefile`.
